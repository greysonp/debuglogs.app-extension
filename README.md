# debuglogs.app Redirect Extension

This is a simple browser extension that redirects requests to debuglogs.org to debuglogs.app.

For more details on debuglogs.app, check out the repo here: [link](https://github.com/greysonp/debuglogs.app)

_The extensions are currently under review in the Chrome and Firefox stores. I will put store links here after they're live._
